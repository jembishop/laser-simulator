# Laser Simulator

An egui app I wrote which simulates a laser using simple photon particles. 
Note that it won't handle the wavelike phenomena like coherence and resonance
as it is a purely particle based simulation.

It simulates the two three and four level configurations, with some explanatory text and animations.
